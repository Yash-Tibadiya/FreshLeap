1. Dashboard Implementation
The authentication system is now complete, but there's no dashboard or main functionality yet. The next logical step is to implement role-specific dashboards:

Farmer Dashboard
Create a dashboard layout with sidebar navigation 
âœ… Implement product management (add, edit, delete products)
Add inventory management features
Create order fulfillment interface
Add sales analytics and reporting

Customer Dashboard
Create a browsing interface for products
Implement category filtering and search
Add product detail pages
Implement shopping cart functionality
Create checkout process
Add order history and tracking

2. Product Management System
Since the database schema already includes Products table:

Create product listing page for farmers to manage their inventory
Implement product creation form with image upload
Add product editing and deletion functionality
Implement inventory tracking (quantity management)
Add product categorization and tagging

3. Shopping Experience
For customers to browse and purchase products:

Create a marketplace homepage with featured products
Implement product search and filtering by category
Add product detail pages with reviews
Create a shopping cart system
Implement checkout process with address collection
4. Order Management
To handle the full order lifecycle:

Create order placement functionality
Implement order status tracking
Add order history for both farmers and customers
Create notification system for order updates
Implement order fulfillment workflow for farmers
5. Payment Integration
To complete the e-commerce functionality:

Integrate a payment gateway (Stripe, PayPal, etc.)
Implement secure checkout process
Add payment confirmation and receipts
Create refund handling system
